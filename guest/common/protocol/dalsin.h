/* Dalsin: AmigaChrome's own Zorro manufacturer number, 0xDA15 (55829),
 * from 1 October 2026. Before that the boards used 2011, the number UAE and
 * home-made test boards share (ShowConfig calls it "UAE Amiga Emulator",
 * Linux's zorro.ids "Hacker Test Board"). 0xDA15 is in neither list.
 *
 * Products stay as they were: 1 ACBridge control, 2 ACStorage, 9 ACRTG,
 * 11 AC090's RAM.
 *
 * Drivers look for Dalsin first, then 2011, so one build works with either.
 * A boot ROM whose drivers do carries DALSIN_ROM_MARK; the runtime presents
 * Dalsin to a ROM that has it and 2011 to one built before. */

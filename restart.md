# Restart: OpenSocket

_Written 6 October 2026 at about 23:55 UTC, while all work is paused on @SacredTrees's word (23:28 UTC). Read this first when work resumes; the newest capsule and the live PR list win if they disagree._

## What this repo is

OpenSocket: bsdsocket.library and a network stack for AmigaOS 3.2, with AmigaChrome's host back end and OpenSocketDirect for real hardware (PiStorm first).

## Where it stands

bsdsocket.library 4.2 with the WaitSelect fix is merged and in OpenUp. OpenSocketControl's Status page shows byte-rotated addresses; that fix is queued with Main Discourse.

## Capsules

Restart capsules for this repo's workstreams, in amigachrome's `capjumps/` shelf:

- [`20261006_AmigaChrome_OpenUp_MainDiscourse_Restart_Capsule.zip`](https://github.com/DalsinAI/amigachrome/tree/main/capjumps)

Team rules that still hold: commits as SacredTrees with no co-author lines; third-party code only on "yes with review" (licence checked, commit and sha256 pinned, fetched at build, never committed); deploys with deploy_dev.py only, on a typed line.
